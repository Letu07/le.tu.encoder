# le.tu.encoder

1.What I have managed to do:
*Create a FileService class that has methods for file reading and writing,
as well as a method for creating a new file with a designated name.
*Create a CaesarCipher class that has methods for encrypting and decrypting text 
and a method for automatically matching the key to the encrypted text and decrypting it.
*Create a Runner class for program processing.
*Create a Constants class to store the English and Ukrainian alphabets.
*Use an enumeration called Command to store necessary commands.
 
2.What I did NOT manage to do from requirements:
*encode the characters '.', ',', '"', '"', '"', '"', '\'', ':', '!', '?', ' '''.
*support for encoding text in Ukrainian
*to determine automatically which alphabet to use for the text (Ukrainian/English).
*make it possible to interact with the application using the command line (CLI).

I was unable to attend due to time constraints,
because I wanted to focus more on the main tasks.

3.Project features:
*The programme encrypts and decrypts text using a key.
*Can also utilize brute force to select the key for decryption. 
*The program creates a new file with the name of the selected text handling method, 
where it contains the result.

4.What a mentor should pay attention to when checking:
*The Constants class includes an unused Ukrainian alphabet. 
Due to time constraints, I could not implement support for this language. 
*Have I succeeded in writing concise code?
